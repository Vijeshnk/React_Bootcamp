 ##### npm is a package manager for node js,it has a repository of open source software and it can be  used by anyone for free.npm makes writing code easier  because we can rely on pre-built code that other people have written,we can use their code for  our  own projects.authors will write  the code for their package and publish it on the npm registry then if we want to use that package  we can install it onto our own computer with the npm cli or command line interface
